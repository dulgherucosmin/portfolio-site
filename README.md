# Portfolio Site

A simple portfolio website built with HTML, TypeScript, and CSS.

## Project structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file to open in the browser
- `script.ts` — TypeScript for interactive behavior (compile to `script.js` if needed)
- `style.css` — Styles for the site
- `assets/` — Images and other static assets

## Features

- Static portfolio site with a responsive layout
- TypeScript used for any interactivity
- Simple file-based structure — no framework required

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd portfolio-site
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site locally.

## Development

- If you use TypeScript, compile `script.ts` to JavaScript:

  ```bash
  npx tsc script.ts
  # or, if you have a tsconfig.json
  npx tsc --watch
  ```

- To serve the site locally, you can use a simple static server (optional):

  ```bash
  npx serve .
  # or using Python
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
